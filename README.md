PEP - Private exe protector is closed commercial project but i decided to share it's source code ( I purchased it about 2300 USD long time ago ) [ Limited ]

" Private exe Protector (PEP) WAS a professional licensing, anti-tampering and software examination system. PEP works with traditional methods, such as file compression, code fragment encryption, metamorphic loading, protection from debugging and file tampering , and features new innovative techniques like data protection with stolen resources technique. All in one, it is the ideal solution for software developers. "

üî•	Wait for Themida,WinLicense,CodeVirtualizer,....  :)
